Each folder in Gait_Time_Series contains one participant's gait data.
Joint kinematics, joint kinetics, muscle forces, IMU, and EMG data for an average number of 16 trials are available for each participant.
Joint kinematics, joint kinetics, and muscle forces data are cut for the period over force plates.
